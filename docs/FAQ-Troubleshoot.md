# Troubleshooting / FAQ

This is the Frequently Asked Questions section.

Navigate it quickly by using the Table of Contents or the search bar; searching is easy, and makes you look cool.. Just saying.

!!! Note: VivumLab does assume some prior knowledge on behalf of the user, if you do not have this knowledge using VivumLab will not be impossible but you may find it hard to troubleshoot any issues you may have.

We assume you know or understand the basics of:
    - your server operating system
    - your client operating system
    - Access via SSH
    - Pointing your domain ('A' record) to the required IP address

## FAQs

### Does VivumLab cost anything?

No, and as long as it remains open source, it never will. If you paid money for this service, get your money back.

### Why did we fork HomeLabOS?
HomeLabOS is a great project, and while we are very similar, we differ in some core values and (general) project direction. VivumLab is an alternative to HomeLabOS, not a replacement; We would like to suggest that you test both projects and see which one suits you; everyone is different and deserves the freedom to choose. If you decide to stick with VivumLab, then Welcome to the community; lets do some amazing things together.

### VivumLab and Open Source
We just want to start by saying open source is very important, a free (as in freedom) internet, is something worth protecting. That being said, you may have noticed that some of the services we provide are open source, and some are not; while VivumLab advocates for and prefers open source projects, we undestand that sometimes a closed source project is required or desired by the user. The least we can do is keep VivumLab open source and free for further generations to come.

## Troubleshooting - Access/ Web

### I have pointed my domain at my IP but accessing the domain returns nothing

* If you [ping](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+ping+a+domain+from+my+OS) your domain, do you get the [IP](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=whats+my+ip) you expect?
    * If not you have [DNS issues](/core/installation/#dns-settings). Get those resolved before moving on.
* If you ping your subdomain, do you get the IP you expect?
    * If not you have [DNS issues](/core/installation/#dns-settings). You probably don't have a wildcard set up.
    * If you're still having issues with your domain, contact your domain registrar (whom you purchased your domain from); there is a good chance that they have their own documentation regarding this.
* Does the IP you expect actually lead to port 80 on your server?
    * You may need to set up port forwarding on your router, unblock some ports on your modem, or contact your ISP to see if they are being blocked. If these aren't an option for you, try the [bastion host](/core/bastion) set up.
* Does the domain you're trying to access match what is listed in the Traefik dashboard?
    * If you don't see your domain under the 'HTTP' section in Traefik, then you have something configured wrong.
* Are your services running?
    * Check **`docker ps`** and **`systemctl status SERVICENAME`** on the server.
        * E.g. **`systemctl status jellyfin`**
* Are your services listed in the Traefik dashboard?
    * Check http://{{ vlab_ip }}:8181/

If you have followed these instructions and you are STILL having issues, ask in [chat](https://vivumlab.zulipchat.com/) or open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Vivumlab/VivumLab/issues).
    !!! Note: The documentation for VivumLab represents hours of work by the developers. Do not be offended if you ask a question, and are redirected back to the documentation. It is entirely for your own benefit; no one elses'.

### I get a 404

If you're up and running, but accessing the server returns a 404, check the Traefik [dashboard](http://{{ vlab_ip }}:8181/).

Each service under the `Http` page has a section. The hostname inside `Host()` in the rule column is the hostname that Traefik is listening to for that particular service. You need to be able to [ping](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+ping+a+domain+from+my+OS) that hostname from your computer, and you should get back the IP address of your server. Once that is the case, accessing the domain name in a browser should load the respective service.

Traefik serves based on domain names, not IP addresses. It has to know what service you want to return. You need to be able to access the domain name in order for Traefik to serve the correct service.

### No Traefik Dashboard

If you can't even access the dashboard at http://{{ vlab_ip }}:8181, check the status of the VivumLab service to give you some insight into what the issue is.
e.g: **`systemctl status vivumlab`**

or: **`docker ps | grep traefik`** and get an output like:
```
8f00f6b3cdb6        traefik                        "/traefik"               13 hours ago        Up 13 hours                     0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8181->8080/tcp           vivumlab_traefik_1
```
### Services Not Appearing in Traefik, Bad Gateway, or Services Restarting

If you don't see the services listed in the Traefik dash, or if Traefik returns a page that just says `Bad Gateway`, that usually means DNS and everything is correct, but the service itself is having problems. SSH into the server and run **`systemctl status SERVICE_NAME`**
e.g: **`systemctl status jellyfin`**

This should show you any Docker logs relevant to that service. In the case of a service running multiple containers, you may want more detail from a specific container.
Find the container name with **`docker ps | grep SERVICENAME`** then access the logs with **`docker logs -f --tail 500 CONTAINERNAME`**.
E.g: **`docker logs -f --tail 500 jellyfin_jellyfin_1`**

### SSL Not working

Traefik generates SSL certs via LetsEncrypt, and LetsEncrypt has rate limiting. So it may take several days before all of your services get valid SSL certs generated for them.
You can tail the logs of the traefik container (as mentioned previously) to see the status of its generation.

## Troubleshooting - Server/ config

### `vlab` command throws a docker related error

* Make sure VivumLab successfully installed docker on the server. If its not installed, try installing it manually.

* Make sure you are running the latest docker and docker compose on both your client and server. The versions installed via your Operating Systems' package manager may be outdated.

!!! Note: [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is some information to help you get started.

* Check VivumLab status on the server and make sure it is loaded and active.
e.g: **`systemctl status vivumlab`**

* Make sure the admin user specified during `vlab config` is created.
e.g: **`compgen -u`**

* If the user isn't listed, run the following commands (on the server) to make one and add it to the sudo and docker groups.
**`sudo adduser <username>`**
**`sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>`**
**`sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`**

### I can't find certain config values like Authelia

Check your `config/vault.yml` file. If it's encrypted just run `vlab decrypt`, and attempt to access it again.

### Is it OK to manually edit my `settings/` files?

Yes, but note that isn't specifically necessary to edit the `config/` files directly, or worry about where the config values are.
Use of **`vlab get`** will access the variable correctly regardless of which config file it lives in.
- eg. **`vlab get jellyfin.domain`**
Use of **`vlab set`** will set the variable correctly,regardless of which config file
- eg. **`vlab set jellyfin.domain=magicfinger.com`**

### I get `exec user process caused 'exec format error'`

You may be trying to run AMD code on ARM infrastructure.
Make sure you have set `arm` to True. e.g: **`vlab get arm`**

You can set it with **`vlab set arm=True`**,
or you can edit your config file. e.g:
```
# Set this to true if you are deploying to an ARM infrastructure, such as a Raspberry Pi.
arm: True
```

### How do I tell if a service is enabled?

On your server, run **`systemctl status servicename`**, as root, or
**`sudo systemctl status servicename`** as another user.
E.g: **`systemctl status jellyfin`**

### I get `Unit servicename.service could not be found.`

The service was not deployed.
Enable the desired service. eg. **`vlab set jellyfin enable=True`**
Alternatively, edit your `settings/` files, and set `enable` to true for the respective service. e.g:
```
jellyfin:
  enable: True
```

### If I don't have a domain, what do I enter for the domain field?

You can use Vivumlab fully inside your network, without an external domain. Simply make up a domain that ends in `.local` and enter that as your domain in `host_vars/myserver`, for example `myvivumlab.local` will work just fine, but there are some small changes that you will need to make.

VivumLab will generate a file called `vivumlab_hosts`on the server, located in the VivumLab root folder; You can use the entries in this file to add to your computer's hosts override file (`/etc/hosts` on *nix based OS'), or to map on your router or DNS server as DNS overrides.

Ultimately, if you used the example fake domain given above and you enabled the Jellyfin service, you can access it at `jellyfin.myvivumlab.local` once you have your DNS overrides set up.

### Can I use a 32 bit OS?

Yes, but you shouldn't. A quick Google search will return some options for you; however VivumLab does not officially support it.

Older version of Raspberry Pi OS (previously Raspbian) are 32 bit and in theory it is possible to use this OS; but again, VivumLab does not officially support it.
